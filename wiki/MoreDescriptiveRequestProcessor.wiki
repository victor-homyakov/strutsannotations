#summary Wrapper for RequestProcessor with more descriptive error messages.

= Introduction =

`RequestProcessor` gives very uninformative error message "Invalid path was requested" when you have mistyped some URL.


= Details =

In big project with many modules, JSPs, scripts and actions it is very hard to find the root cause of error
{{{
ERROR [RequestProcessor] Invalid path was requested
}}}
sometimes appearing in log files.

`MoreDescriptiveRequestProcessor` overrides original `RequestProcessor` and mitigates this problem by printing additional request information: `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getRequestURI()`.
